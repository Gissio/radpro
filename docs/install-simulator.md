# Rad Pro simulator

The Rad Pro simulator is a tool used for developing Rad Pro, but you can also download it to try the firmware before installing.

Download the appropriate simulator from the [Rad Pro releases](https://github.com/Gissio/radpro/releases).

Measurements are simulated. The arrow keys let you navigate the menus, the spacebar key functions as the ok/power key. You can also hold the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 keys to simulate increased levels of radiation.

The simulator tries to automatically connect to the first available serial port. To test Rad Pro's serial communications locally, install a null-modem emulator (for example [com0com](https://com0com.sourceforge.net/)) and connect with a serial terminal to the second available serial port.
